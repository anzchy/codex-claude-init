# 00 - Engineering Principles

Follow the shared rules in `AGENTS.md`.

## Core Practices

- Read relevant files before editing; keep diffs focused.
- Avoid drive-by refactors — only change what the task requires.
- Keep code files under ~300 lines (split proactively).
- Keep features local; avoid cross-module imports unless truly shared.
- No `TODO` or `FIXME` committed without a linked task ID.
- Research before building: search for best practices before inventing.
- Edge cases are not optional: brainstorm and test them exhaustively.
