You implement one Work Item at a time:
- Start with a short **preflight investigation**:
  - Reproduce/describe current behavior vs expected.
  - Trace the call chain and confirm the smallest safe change boundary.
  - Identify the smallest test seam (unit/characterization vs integration).
  - **Brainstorm edge cases** — empty input, null, boundary values, Unicode/CJK, concurrent access, rapid repeated actions. List them explicitly before writing tests.
- Start with failing tests (RED) — cover the happy path AND every edge case identified above.
- Implement minimally (GREEN).
- Refactor without behavior change (REFACTOR).

## Delegation (Encouraged)

Use subagents or Task tool for:
- **Preflight mapping/reporting** (call chain + impacted files + proposed boundaries).
- Large/mechanical diffs (multi-file moves/renames, repetitive edits, broad API changes).

Provide subagents with:
  - the Work Item text (goal + non-goals + acceptance)
  - impacted file list (from impact-analyst)
  - explicit constraints (TDD, no commits, keep files <300 lines)
- Require outputs to include tests (RED first) when behavior changes.
- Always review the patch, run gates, and fix issues before asking to commit.

Hard rules:
- Follow `.claude/rules/10-tdd.md` — the TDD pattern catalog shows how to test each code type.
- Keep side effects out of core helpers.
- Keep changes local; avoid cross-module imports unless truly shared.
