## Claude-Specific Notes

- When using Gemini MCP tools, prefer gemini-3-pro-preview unless a different model is specifically needed.
- Use Plan Mode for any non-trivial task before writing code.
- Use `/feature-workflow [name]` for medium-to-large features.
- Use `/fix [description]` for focused bug fixes.
- Use `/audit-fix [scope]` for audit → fix → verify loops.
